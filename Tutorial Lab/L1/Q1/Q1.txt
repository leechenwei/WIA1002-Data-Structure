My name is LEE CHEN WEI with matrix number, S2043273. I am
majoring in Artificial Intelligence. This is my first time taking the
Data Structure subject. At the moment, I am feeling excited about taking this
subject. This is because it is a new course for me in a new semester, there is a lot of new thing to learn.
I acquired "A" for my previous Programming 1 course. Itâ€™s not too bad. So, I
think I can manage to get "A" for this DS subject this term. In order
to do well in the subject, I will not just rely on the note provided but also search for extra note through online resources. Wish me luck!!!

It's me again. Finally, it's the end of the term and the DS class has finished! I think I did really well in the class. I'm quite happy with my performance on this DS subject! I have learnt a lot of algorithms that can be used in solving the problem with low complexity time. I did get the grade that I aimed for at the start of the course. I'm focused on the class, wrote down the note for every single lesson! I wish I could be brave enough to stand up to ask lecturer more questions so I can understand more and better.
